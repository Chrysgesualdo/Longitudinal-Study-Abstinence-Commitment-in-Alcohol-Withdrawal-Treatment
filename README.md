# Project Title: Longitudinal Study â€“ Abstinence Commitment in Alcohol Withdrawal Treatment

## Techniques Used:
- Longitudinal study design
- Exploratory data analysis
- Descriptive statistics
- Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
- ANOVA
- Regression analyses
- Breath alcohol tests
- SPSS Statistics software

## Summary:
My research group and I investigated changes in inner commitment to abstinence among 122 patients in inpatient alcohol withdrawal. Commitment was assessed using the CSS at multiple points during treatment. Using ANOVA and regression analyses, we found that commitment significantly increased from the third week and predicted actual abstinence, abstinent days, and drinking quantity. This effect remained significant even when controlling for other motivational factors.
